Fusion of local context + Internet search for better query rewriting and Gemini calls

## Overview

This project combines local context with internet search to enhance query rewriting and Gemini calls. It leverages two main components: `fusion.py` and `store.py`.

## Components

### fusion.py
This script is responsible for merging local context data with search results from the internet. It processes the input queries and refines them to improve the accuracy and relevance of the search results.

### store.py
This script handles the storage and retrieval of data. It ensures that the local context data is efficiently managed and can be quickly accessed when needed for query processing.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed.
2. **Run fusion.py**: Execute this script to process and refine your queries.
3. **Run store.py**: Use this script to manage your local context data.
